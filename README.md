## Skills

**Problem Solving** - During my 6+ years as an IT Support Analyst, I collaborated extensively with peers, IT management, and other engineers to resolve technical issues. This molded me into becoming highly experienced in investigating root causes of failures and implementation a solution or quick work around.
* I achieved being called the *'mobile device guru'* for my extensive knowledge and troubleshooting skills in identifying issues with mobile devices.   

**Communication** - My previous roles involved working closely with various teams to develop compliance and other regulatory documents. This led to the implementation of security policies and end users training documentation.
- I achieved developing and implementing best practices and procedures by sending weekly IT tips to end users.
- I contributed to the education of end users by carrying out IT induction training with individuals at all levels 

**Time Management** - I developed a process of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific activities. This allowed me to complete my foundation degree online with Open University, whilst working full-time.

**Quick Learner** - My most recent role saw me joining a scaling finance-technology company to set up and pull their IT Support function in-house. More about it on the company's meet the team [blog](https://blog.marketinvoice.com/2018/09/05/marketinvoice-shaneil-clarke/).
